* draw can remain focus-neutral. If the parent wants, it can draw
  the right child's focus when it wants to.

* Grid should not be a Widget, but a ChildContainer

  * ChildContainer makes you specify functions that:

    * prechildren draw, postchildren draw -- these will get a
      haveFocus Bool, which the ChildContainer implementation will
      hand them.

    * 

  * Can have a FocusWidget that can hold a widget that tells it who the inner
    widget is, and it will handle return/escape as either:
    * Switch to the inner widget completely
    * Switch focus to inner widget, but still draw outer widget

    * Doing this by delegating the handlers and draw is easy, but if you want to 

  * How can it draw the focus correctly?
    * FocusWidget needs to tell the outer widget draw itself with/without focus

    * If Grid is responsible for the drawing of the sub-widgets, and it doesn't
      know whether its in focus or not -- how can it tell them to draw focused or not?

    * If someone else does the drawing, then its ugly

* Abstract away all of the SDLness in MySDL/Draw and rename it HaskGame? :-)
* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around
* Widgets need to return the size, separately from drawing, and then
  draw into that size.
* Do widgets need an update function, beyond input events?
