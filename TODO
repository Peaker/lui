* Remove the Immutable once again?  If Widget is exposed to be (model->)
  then just have the "new" caller do \model -> (new ...) model if it wants to?

* Box with delete

* Abstract away SDL keyboard keys, events, flip and delay
  * Implement a GLUT-based version

* Plan editor:
  * The model can be an AST
    * Keys associated with manipulating the AST model
    * Accessors to model can convert AST to the widget form

  * Revision control (Diff management?)
    * Model accessors can put extra information in model about how to save only the
      changes

* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around

* Can I create a generic newDelegate method in FocusDelegator instead of 
  copying it into each widget?

Possible bug?  We pass (const immutable-value-here) for the given model that we were given, but then the guy we pass it to may receive different models and still make this const value?
