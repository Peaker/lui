* draw can remain focus-neutral. If the parent wants, it can draw
  the right child's focus when it wants to.

* Grid should not be a Widget.
  Grid.new returns a WidgetManager.
  WidgetManager has a container field that points to the Grid inside it.

instance Widget Grid where
  draw (Grid cm) = cmDraw cm

  * Every user of a WidgetContainer has to implement (e.g Grid):
    * draw function -- manually calls children, manually computes drawinfo for children
    * focused keymap -- Handlers for when it has direct focus
    * parenting keymap -- Handlers for when it has parenting focus
    * children and positions
    * currently selected child

* Abstract away all of the SDLness in MySDL/Draw and rename it HaskGame? :-)
* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around
* Widgets need to return the size, separately from drawing, and then
  draw into that size.
* Do widgets need an update function, beyond input events?
