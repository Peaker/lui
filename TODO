* When a widget is shown a state, should it be able to fix it, what if
  its inconsistent? For example, a widget inside state becomes
  unselectable

* Everything contains everything via existentials, so how can you in
  fact get access to the state?

* Grid:
  * should be able to jump to a selectable child if children become unselectable,
    it controls children status changes because it handles them...
  * should allow jumping to a child even if path via straight lines is not possible

* Is it a good idea to use the AnyWidgetState existential all over the place, and
  lose type information?

* Abstract away all of the SDLness in MySDL/Draw and rename it HaskGame? :-)

* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around
