* Abstract away SDL keyboard keys, events, flip and delay
  * Implement a GLUT-based version

* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around

Possible bug?  We pass (const immutable-value-here) for the given model that we were given, but then the guy we pass it to may receive different models and still make this const value?
