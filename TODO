* Is it a good idea to have "new" return existential widgets? How do you "edit"
  w and s values then?
* Is it a good idea to use the AnyWidgetState existential all over the place, and
  lose type information?

* Abstract away all of the SDLness in MySDL/Draw and rename it HaskGame? :-)

* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around
