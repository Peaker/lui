* Grid/Box contain differently-typed widgets in them, so the only way
  to not lose type information, is to have some sort of tuple (type
  product).
  

* Abstract away all of the SDLness in MySDL/Draw and rename it HaskGame? :-)

* When a widget is shown a state, should it be able to fix it, what if
  its inconsistent? For example, a widget inside state becomes
  unselectable

* Grid:
  * should be able to jump to a selectable child if children become unselectable,
    it controls children status changes because it handles them...
  * should allow jumping to a child even if path via straight lines is not possible

* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around
