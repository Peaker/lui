* Abstract away all of the SDLness in MySDL/Draw and rename it HaskGame? :-)

* When a widget is shown a state, should it be able to fix it, what if
  its inconsistent? For example, a widget inside state becomes
  unselectable

* Grid:
  * should be able to jump to a selectable child if children become unselectable,
    it controls children status changes because it handles them...
  * should allow jumping to a child even if path via straight lines is not possible

* Animations:
  * Draw -> Animate?
    * Can use ID's on all drawings, and have it animate stuff moving around


Possible bug?  We pass (const immutable-value-here) for the given model that we were given, but then the guy we pass it to may receive different models and still make this const value?
